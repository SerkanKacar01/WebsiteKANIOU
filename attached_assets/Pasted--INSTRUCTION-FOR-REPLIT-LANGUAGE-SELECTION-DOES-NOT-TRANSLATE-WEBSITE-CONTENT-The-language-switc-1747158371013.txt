âœ… INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT â€” LANGUAGE SELECTION DOES NOT TRANSLATE WEBSITE CONTENT

The language switcher is visible and clickable, but selecting a language does not change the text on the website. The interface stays in the original language or does not respond at all.

This is a critical issue that must be fixed completely so that changing the language actually updates the entire website content.

â¸»

ðŸ“Œ GOAL:

Make sure that when a user selects a language from the dropdown (EN, FR, NL, TR, AR), all visible content on the page is instantly updated to that language or reloaded correctly.

â¸»

âœ… WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
	1.	Activate language switching logic
	â€¢	Selecting a language must trigger the i18n.changeLanguage() or equivalent function used in your app
	â€¢	The selected language must be applied to the entire app context (not just stored)
	2.	Store the selected language
	â€¢	Save the selected language in localStorage or cookies so it persists after refresh or page change
	3.	Ensure the app watches the selected language
	â€¢	All pages and components must automatically re-render when the language changes
	â€¢	Use a reactive or observer pattern if needed
	4.	Verify language files are loaded
	â€¢	All five language files (en.json, fr.json, nl.json, tr.json, ar.json) must exist
	â€¢	Make sure they are being loaded properly at runtime
	â€¢	If the file is missing or contains errors, fix it or fallback to English
	5.	Apply translations to every text
	â€¢	Every visible word (header, navigation, footer, buttons, forms, titles, placeholders) must use a translation key
	â€¢	No hardcoded strings should be used
	6.	Arabic (AR) must render Right-To-Left
	â€¢	When ar is selected, the HTML body must use dir="rtl"
	â€¢	The font, alignment, and flow must adjust accordingly
	7.	Fix the dropdown
	â€¢	Make sure the language dropdown updates the interface immediately
	â€¢	Replace raw keys (language.en, language.fr) with correct native names like:
	â€¢	English
	â€¢	FranÃ§ais
	â€¢	Nederlands
	â€¢	TÃ¼rkÃ§e
	â€¢	Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±Ø¨ÙŠØ©
