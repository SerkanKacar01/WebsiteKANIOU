GLOBAL COLOR UPDATE (KANIU Website)

Dear Replit team,

I would like to apply a site-wide color adjustment to ensure visual consistency across all components of the KANIOU website. Below are the detailed instructions:

‚∏ª

1. üé® PRIMARY ACCENT COLOR (FOR BUTTONS, LINKS, HIGHLIGHTS)

Purpose: Use this for all primary call-to-action buttons such as ‚ÄúOfferte Aanvragen‚Äù, highlights, icons, section headers, borders where relevant, and accent areas.
	‚Ä¢	HEX: #D9C29C
	‚Ä¢	RGB: rgb(217, 194, 156)
	‚Ä¢	Usage: Button backgrounds, pricing highlights, icons, header accent bars.

üìù Example elements:
	‚Ä¢	Button: ‚ÄúOFFERT AANVRAGEN‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Highlighted info cards
	‚Ä¢	Navigation hover colors

‚∏ª

2. üü° SECONDARY LIGHT BACKGROUND COLOR (FOR BLOCKS & SECTIONS)

Purpose: Use this for subtle backgrounds behind boxes, info sections, comparison blocks, or to soften layout breaks between white and content areas.
	‚Ä¢	HEX: #E8D9B8
	‚Ä¢	RGB: rgb(232, 217, 184)
	‚Ä¢	Usage: Section backgrounds, quote blocks, feature rows, card components.

üìù Example elements:
	‚Ä¢	Info box backgrounds
	‚Ä¢	Behind section: ‚ÄúWaarom kiezen voor KANIOU Business?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Newsletter CTA section

‚∏ª

3. üî§ TEXT COLOR

Important: Maintain pure white text (#FFFFFF) or dark grey (#222222) depending on background contrast. Do not change primary text colors unless contrast is impacted.

‚∏ª

4. ‚úÖ GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE

Please apply these color adjustments across the entire website as follows:
	‚Ä¢	Navigation bar & CTA buttons
	‚Ä¢	Hero sections & overlays
	‚Ä¢	Chatbot UI elements (where accent or background applies)
	‚Ä¢	Newsletter banner
	‚Ä¢	Form submission buttons
	‚Ä¢	Section cards, pricing panels, and quote boxes

‚∏ª

5. ‚ö†Ô∏è CLARIFICATIONS
	‚Ä¢	Please use HEX values for static styling like backgrounds, buttons, borders.
	‚Ä¢	Use RGB or RGBA if transparency or shadows are involved.
	‚Ä¢	Make sure color changes are responsive and visible in both desktop and mobile views.
	‚Ä¢	Keep current layout, spacing, and design structure intact‚Äîdo not alter structure or remove any content blocks.
