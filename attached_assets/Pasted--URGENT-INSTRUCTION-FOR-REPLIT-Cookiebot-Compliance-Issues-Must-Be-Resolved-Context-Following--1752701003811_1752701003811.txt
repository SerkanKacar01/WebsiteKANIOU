ðŸ“¢ URGENT INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT â€“ Cookiebot Compliance Issues Must Be Resolved

Context:
Following a Cookiebot scan and official email dated 15/07/2025, the domain kaniou.be is not GDPR-compliant. The Cookiebot script is installed, but cookies are being set before consent, which is a violation of privacy laws such as the GDPR.

ðŸš¨ Detected Problems (to be resolved by Replit):
	1.	Cookiebot is NOT the first script loaded on the website.
	â€¢	The Cookiebot script (https://consent.cookiebot.com/uc.js) must be the very first script in the <head> tag or immediately after <body>.
	â€¢	No other JavaScript or third-party scripts may be loaded before it.
	2.	Some scripts are setting cookies before consent.
	â€¢	These scripts are not properly marked up or excluded from Cookiebot control.
	â€¢	Scripts must be manually marked with type="text/plain" and only activated upon consent.
	â€¢	Alternatively, Cookiebotâ€™s automatic blocking mode should be enabled to handle this.
	3.	Google Tag Manager (if used) is not integrated with Cookiebot.
	â€¢	If GTM is in use, it must wait for Cookiebot consent before loading any tags.
	â€¢	Cookiebot must control tag firing through consent state values (e.g., marketing, statistics, preferences).
	â€¢	Replit must follow the official GTM integration guide.
	4.	Server-side cookies are being set without consent.
	â€¢	These cookies are generated by the web server (initiator: Webserver) before user interaction.
	â€¢	These must be blocked through server-side logic, and only be set after consent.
	â€¢	Replit must review all back-end responses and delay setting any non-necessary cookies.
	5.	Unclassified cookies are present.
	â€¢	Cookies like kaniou-language, kaniou_has_visited, and cookiePreferencesReferrer are unclassified.
	â€¢	These must be:
	â€¢	Categorized correctly in the Cookiebot Manager (e.g. as Preferences, Statistics, or Marketing)
	â€¢	Provided with a clear purpose description

â¸»

ðŸš« DO NOT:
	â€¢	Do not change, remove, or adjust the design or layout of the website.
	â€¢	Do not modify any visual elements, spacing, fonts, or structure.
	â€¢	Only focus on fixing Cookiebot placement, blocking behavior, and consent compliance.

â¸»

âœ… Final Goal:
	â€¢	The Cookiebot consent banner must appear immediately on first visit.
	â€¢	No cookies may be set before consent, except for strictly necessary ones.
	â€¢	All scripts and server behavior must comply with GDPR and Cookiebot integration requirements.
