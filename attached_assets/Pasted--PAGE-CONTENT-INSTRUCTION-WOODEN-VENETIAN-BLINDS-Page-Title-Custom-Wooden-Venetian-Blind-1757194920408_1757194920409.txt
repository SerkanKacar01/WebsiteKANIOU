❓ Frequently Asked Questions:

1. What’s the difference between ladder cord and ladder tape?
Ladder cord is thinner and more minimalist. Ladder tape is wider and provides a more luxurious visual effect.

2. Are wooden blinds suitable for bathrooms?
We do not recommend wooden blinds in humid rooms. Consider PVC blinds instead for such spaces.

3. Can the blinds be motorized?
Yes, electric operation via remote control or mobile app (BREL) is available.
