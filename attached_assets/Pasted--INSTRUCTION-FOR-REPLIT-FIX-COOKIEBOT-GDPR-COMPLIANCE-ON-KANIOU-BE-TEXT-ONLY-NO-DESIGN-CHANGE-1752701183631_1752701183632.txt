üîß INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT ‚Äì FIX COOKIEBOT GDPR COMPLIANCE ON KANIOU.BE (TEXT ONLY ‚Äì NO DESIGN CHANGES)

Background:
As per the Cookiebot scan and official communication dated 15/07/2025, the domain kaniou.be is currently not GDPR-compliant. Cookies are being loaded in the browser before user consent is given, which violates GDPR and EU cookie laws.

‚∏ª

‚ùó URGENT ISSUES TO FIX:
	1.	Cookiebot script is not the first loaded.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the Cookiebot script (uc.js) is the very first script loaded in the <head> section of every page, before any other JavaScript, inline scripts, or third-party libraries.
	‚Ä¢	This includes all CSS/JS bundlers, preloaders, or UI frameworks that may come before Cookiebot.
	2.	Cookies are set before user consent.
	‚Ä¢	Several non-essential cookies (e.g. language, visit tracking, etc.) are initiated before consent.
	‚Ä¢	These must be blocked until explicit consent is given, either by:
	‚Ä¢	Manual markup (type="text/plain" and data-cookieconsent)
	‚Ä¢	Or activating Cookiebot automatic blocking mode
	3.	Unclassified cookies are active.
	‚Ä¢	Cookies like kaniou-language, kaniou_has_visited, and cookiePreferencesReferrer are not categorized.
	‚Ä¢	These must be defined in Cookiebot as either:
	‚Ä¢	Strictly Necessary
	‚Ä¢	Preferences
	‚Ä¢	Statistics
	‚Ä¢	Marketing
	‚Ä¢	Provide a short purpose description in Cookiebot dashboard for each one.
	4.	Google Tag Manager (GTM) support (if applicable).
	‚Ä¢	If GTM is used, it must wait for Cookiebot‚Äôs consent state before loading any tags.
	‚Ä¢	Configure GTM with Cookiebot‚Äôs consent values (marketing, statistics, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Use the official Cookiebot GTM setup guide: https://www.cookiebot.com/en/google-tag-manager/
	5.	Webserver-set cookies must be blocked server-side.
	‚Ä¢	Some cookies are set by the backend server before any JavaScript loads (Initiator: Webserver).
	‚Ä¢	These cookies must be held back via conditional logic until the user‚Äôs consent is submitted.
	‚Ä¢	Replit must modify the backend logic to only serve these cookies after consent.

‚∏ª

üö´ STRICT RULE: DO NOT TOUCH DESIGN OR LAYOUT
	‚Ä¢	Do not change anything related to design.
	‚Ä¢	No changes to visual layout, spacing, CSS, headers, footers, containers or typography.
	‚Ä¢	This task is strictly technical and only for GDPR/cookie behavior.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ FINAL GOAL
	‚Ä¢	When a visitor lands on kaniou.be, the Cookiebot banner must appear immediately.
	‚Ä¢	No non-essential cookies may load until the user gives explicit consent.
	‚Ä¢	All cookies must be categorized and have a purpose description.
	‚Ä¢	The site must fully pass the Cookiebot GDPR scan and function accordingly.
