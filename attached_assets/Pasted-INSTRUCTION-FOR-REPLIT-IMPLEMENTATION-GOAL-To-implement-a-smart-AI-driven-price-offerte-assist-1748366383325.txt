INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION

⸻

GOAL:

To implement a smart AI-driven price/offerte assistant within the chatbot that:
	1.	Detects when a customer asks about prices, quotations, or costs.
	2.	Sends an immediate notification to Serkan (admin) for input.
	3.	Allows Serkan to input a custom answer for that product/situation.
	4.	Trains the AI chatbot to automatically respond to similar future questions using that input.

⸻

STEP 1: INTENT DETECTION FOR PRICE/OFFERTE REQUESTS
	•	Create keyword-based intent detection in the chatbot backend.
	•	If the user sends a message containing ANY of the following:
	•	“price”, “cost”, “quote”, “quotation”, “offer”, “how much”
	•	Dutch variants: “prijs”, “offerte”, “kost”, “hoeveel kost”

Then the chatbot should trigger a fallback flag: price_request_detected = true and execute the next step.

STEP 2: NOTIFICATION TO ADMIN (SERKAN)

If price_request_detected === true:
	•	Send an email to info@kaniou.be
	•	Subject: “[Chatbot] New Price Request from Customer”
	•	Body should include:
	•	The full message from the user
	•	Timestamp
	•	Optional: user’s name/email if known
	•	A link to respond (can link to a form, or admin panel input field)

STEP 3: ADMIN INPUT PANEL

Create a simple backend route /admin/price-response where Serkan can:
	•	View the question from the user
	•	Input a response (price, offer, explanation)
	•	Link it to a keyword or phrase (e.g. “2m rolgordijnen wit”)
	•	Submit the response

This input should be:
	•	Saved to a local knowledge table in the database or JSON file
	•	Structured as:

{
  "trigger": "2m rolgordijnen wit",
  "response": "De prijs voor 2 meter rolgordijnen in wit is €85 inclusief maatwerk, exclusief montage."
}

STEP 4: AI RESPONSE LEARNING

On every incoming customer message:
	•	Check knowledge base for any match on keywords in the message
	•	If a match is found:
	•	Return the stored response as the chatbot reply
	•	Do not send a new notification (because response is already known)

STEP 5: LOGGING & REVIEW
	•	Every time the AI uses a learned answer, save the event in a log:

{
  "used_response": "2m rolgordijnen wit",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-27T14:32:00Z",
  "customer_question": "Hoeveel kost 2 meter wit rolgordijn?"
}


⸻

NOTES
	•	Everything must be multilingual-ready (EN + NL)
	•	All texts must be editable by Serkan in future
	•	Use proper security/authentication for admin access
	•	Rate-limit notifications to max 3/min to avoid spam

✅ Confirm completion of each step separately before moving on
✅ Serkan will test each flow step-by-step and approve
✅ Do NOT skip any sub-step unless confirmed by Serkan
