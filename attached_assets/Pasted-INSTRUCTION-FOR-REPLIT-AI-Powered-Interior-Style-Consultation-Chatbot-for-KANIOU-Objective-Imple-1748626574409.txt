INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT — AI-Powered Interior Style Consultation Chatbot for KANIOU

Objective:
Implement a multilingual, AI-powered interior consultation assistant that automatically helps users choose the right window décor products based on their room type, style preferences, functional needs (light/privacy), and optionally budget or color choices. The system should generate expert-level suggestions and guide customers smoothly — with minimal manual input from the business owner.

🔧 Core Features to Implement

1. 💬 Intelligent Style Consultation Dialog Flow

The chatbot should initiate a conversational flow that dynamically adapts to the user’s answers. It must include the following logic:
	•	Ask which room the customer is decorating (e.g. living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.).
	•	Ask what their primary goal is (e.g. privacy, blackout, heat control, style).
	•	Ask about their preferred interior style (e.g. modern, classic, Japandi, Scandinavian, industrial).
	•	Optionally ask about color preferences, material preferences, or budget range.

The chatbot should NEVER overwhelm the user with too many options at once. Instead, guide them step-by-step, using simple, human questions in their chosen language.

2. 🧠 Style-to-Product Logic (Design Engine)

The chatbot should use a predefined logic map to generate expert recommendations. This logic must be implemented via structured prompt-injection or data rules, such as:
	•	Modern + Bedroom → Duo roller blinds in light grey, taupe, or white
	•	Classic + Living Room → Floor-length blackout curtains or sheer-over-curtain combo
	•	Bathroom → Avoid wood; suggest aluminum or polyester materials only
	•	Kitchen + Industrial → Slimline aluminium venetian blinds or screen shades
	•	Small window → Prefer light fabrics, avoid heavy curtains
	•	Skylight → Only show Fakro/Velux compatible skylight shades

If needed, ask the user for measurements or show inspiration photos.

✅ The goal is to generate recommendations that match the user’s room, style, and function — using only KANIOU’s official product range.

3. 🌍 Multilingual Experience

The system must support full conversations in the following languages:
	•	🇳🇱 Dutch
	•	🇫🇷 French
	•	🇹🇷 Turkish
	•	🇬🇧 English
	•	🇸🇦 Arabic (optional)

The chatbot should detect or follow the selected language and translate:
	•	Questions
	•	Recommendations
	•	Product descriptions
	•	Pricing estimates
	•	Call-to-action follow-ups

No mixed-language responses are allowed.

4. 🖼️ Visual Mockups (Optional AI-generated sketch)

Once a recommendation is made, show a simple AI-generated mockup of:
	•	A typical window with the selected product type installed
	•	Style adapted to the user’s answers
	•	Not exact to-scale, but emotionally convincing and professional

This can be achieved using OpenAI’s image API, predefined image templates, or simple component-based visuals.

5. 💸 Price Estimation

The chatbot must include realistic pricing ranges based on:
	•	Product type
	•	General sizes (e.g. “Standard 100x150cm starts from €95”)
	•	Material options (e.g. “+10% for blackout fabric”)

No exact quotes — only estimations unless a calculator is used.

6. 🔔 Escalation Logic

If the user asks something outside the AI’s scope, or requests a human:
	•	Send an email alert to the admin (KANIOU) with the conversation log
	•	Display this message (in correct language):

“Thank you for your question. A KANIOU interior specialist will contact you within 24 hours with tailored advice.”

Admin emails must include:
	•	Visitor’s question
	•	Product or style discussed
	•	Contact data if shared

7. ✅ Content Safety & Brand Protection
	•	The AI must only recommend official KANIOU products.
	•	Never invent or assume products, prices, or services not included in the approved product list.
	•	All prompts must be grounded in real product categories and brand voice.

8. 🎯 Final Step: Call-to-Action

After showing suggestions, the bot should ask:

“Would you like to receive a free, personalized quote based on your choices?”

If yes:
	•	Ask for name, email, and address (optional)
	•	Send data via email to the admin or store it if CRM is integrated

📦 Inputs Required From Client (One-Time Setup)

Replit should allow the client (KANIOU) to provide these once:
	1.	Full list of product categories (e.g. roller blinds, curtains, shutters)
	2.	Styles (e.g. modern, classic, industrial)
	3.	Basic features per product (e.g. blackout, light filtering, materials, price range)
	4.	Sample images or links (optional)
	5.	Price ranges for estimation

These will power the structured prompts and logic engine.

✅ Result:

A fully automated and professional design advisor system that speaks with real design intelligence — available 24/7, supports 5 languages, and offers expert suggestions without needing the business owner to intervene.
