⸻

Instruction for Replit:

Please update the AI chatbot on my website so that it is fully capable of answering visitor questions using all available content from the website — this is mandatory.

⸻

🧠 Objective:

Make the chatbot intelligent, dynamic, and helpful by having it use the entire content of the KANIOU website to answer customer questions in real time.

⸻

✅ Required Implementation:
	1.	Use all live website content as data source (mandatory):
The chatbot must be able to access and use all relevant information from the website, including:
	•	Services (e.g. measurement at home, installation, delivery times)
	•	All product categories and descriptions (gordijnen, jaloezieën, rolgordijnen, shutters, etc.)
	•	FAQ, about us, contact pages
	•	Price estimation logic, promotions, customization options
	•	Any dynamic content that explains what the company offers
	2.	Answer questions based on real content
The chatbot must be able to:
	•	Detect the topic or product mentioned
	•	Search and use matching content from the website
	•	Respond accurately, without fallback messages like “not available” or “contact support”
	3.	Example:
	•	Visitor asks: “Komen jullie meten?”
	•	The chatbot replies:
“Ja, wij komen gratis opmeten aan huis binnen België. Je kunt een afspraak maken via het offerteformulier of telefonisch contact opnemen.”
	4.	Avoid generic replies:
Completely remove generic messages like:
	•	“I am not available right now”
	•	“Please contact support”
Replace them with real, content-based responses.
	5.	Support multiple languages (optional but preferred):
	•	Dutch (primary), English, French, Turkish
	•	Detect language based on input or flag selector
	6.	Allow continued expansion:
	•	The chatbot should support future updates when new pages or products are added.
	•	If possible, automatically sync new content or allow manual uploads of additional information.

⸻

✅ Final Result:
	•	The chatbot becomes a real digital assistant, trained on all KANIOU website content.
	•	Can handle product advice, offer requests, delivery info, measurement appointments, and more.
	•	Visitors get fast, relevant answers — no more vague fallback messages.
