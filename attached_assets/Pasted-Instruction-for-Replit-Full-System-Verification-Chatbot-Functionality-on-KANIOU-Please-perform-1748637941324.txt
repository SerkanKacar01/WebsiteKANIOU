Instruction for Replit (Full System Verification – Chatbot Functionality on KANIOU):

Please perform a complete verification and confirmation of all chatbot functions currently implemented on the KANIOU website. This includes all multilingual logic, interface behavior, and functional triggers. Focus on the following mandatory points:

✅ Phase 1: Smart Suggestion Buttons
	•	Verify that all 6 smart suggestion buttons appear automatically when a new user opens the chatbot.
	•	Ensure each button is localized in the selected user language (Dutch, French, English, Turkish).
	•	Confirm the following buttons are present and functioning:
	1.	Free Measurement (Gratis inmeten aanvragen)
	2.	Style Advice (Stijladvies krijgen)
	3.	Quote Request (Offerte aanvragen)
	4.	Product Gallery (Productvoorbeelden bekijken)
	5.	Product Info (Wat voor producten bieden jullie aan?)
	6.	Window Treatment Help (Help me de juiste raambekleding te kiezen)
	•	Each button must trigger the correct pre-programmed conversation flow.
	•	Buttons must disappear when clicked or when user types, and reappear after 24h of inactivity.

✅ Phase 2: Form Submission Check
	•	Test the quote request form submission:
	•	Ensure name and email are recorded.
	•	Verify that the data is sent to info@kaniou.com upon agreement.
	•	Confirm the checkbox and privacy message behave correctly.

✅ Phase 3: Chat End Flow
	•	After user finishes a conversation, display a final message:
	•	“Would you like to end this chat or explore other options?”
	•	Provide 2 buttons:
	•	✅ “End Chat” → Show thank you + auto close after 2 seconds
	•	➕ “See Options” → Redisplay all 6 smart suggestion buttons

✅ Phase 4: Multilingual Accuracy
	•	Check that all chatbot text (questions, suggestions, forms, system prompts) adapts perfectly to the user-selected language.
	•	Make sure no mixed-language output is shown.

✅ Phase 5: Stability & Responsiveness
	•	Test on both desktop and mobile views.
	•	Ensure no buttons, messages, or forms overflow or break layout.
	•	Confirm that chatbot responds instantly and without delay to user input.
