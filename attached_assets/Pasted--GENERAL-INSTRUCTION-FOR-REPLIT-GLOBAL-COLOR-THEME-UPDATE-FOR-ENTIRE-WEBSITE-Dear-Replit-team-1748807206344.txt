🎨 COLOR THEME TO BE USED EVERYWHERE

1. PRIMARY ACCENT COLOR

This should be used for:
– All main buttons,
– Hover effects,
– Highlights,
– CTA (Call to Action) elements,
– Chatbot header or accent areas.
	•	HEX: #D9C29C
	•	RGB: rgb(217, 194, 156)

⸻

2. LIGHT BACKGROUND COLOR

Use this as a soft section background in between white sections to create contrast, for example:
– Under quote forms,
– In newsletter blocks,
– Behind feature panels,
– Or in chatbot suggestion areas.
	•	HEX: #E8D9B8
	•	RGB: rgb(232, 217, 184)

3. TEXT COLOR (IMPORTANT)
	•	White text (#FFFFFF) must be used on dark or accent backgrounds.
