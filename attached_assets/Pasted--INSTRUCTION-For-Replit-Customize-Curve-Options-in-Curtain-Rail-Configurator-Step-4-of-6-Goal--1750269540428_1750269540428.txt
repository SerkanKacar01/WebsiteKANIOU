Goal: Replace the default 90° curve options with visual model-based selections + custom sketch option.

⸻

🛠️ TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY REPLIT DEVELOPMENT TEAM

⸻

1. Remove Existing Options:

Remove the following options from the curve step:
	•	90° Inside Curve
	•	90° Outside Curve

These options should no longer appear for the user.

⸻

2. Keep and Rename:

Keep the option:

No Curve – Straight rail without bends
➤ This should remain selected by default and clearly labeled as Free.

⸻

3. Add New Option:

Introduce a new option labeled:

Custom Bent – Special curve on request
➤ This will open additional selection when clicked.

⸻

4. When “Custom Bent” is selected, do the following:

a) Show Curve Model Gallery:

Display a visual grid of curve types (like in the example screenshots), including:
	•	Small preview images of each model.
	•	Unique identifiers like Model A, Model B1, Model C, etc.
	•	Clickable thumbnails (only one model can be selected at a time).

b) Selection Interaction:

Once a model is selected:
	•	Highlight the selected model.
	•	Below the image, show input fields based on the model’s structure (e.g. A, B, C, D, E lengths in cm).

c) Side Input Fields:
	•	Display side length input fields for each part of the model.
	•	Each input must be in centimeters.
	•	If possible, show a dynamic diagram preview of the selected model with labels.

⸻

5. Add “Custom Design Upload” Option:

Below the models, add a separate selection called:

Submit Your Own Design
➤ This allows the user to upload their own sketch or provide custom instructions.
Add info text:
“Have a unique rail shape in mind? Upload your drawing or describe your layout during the quote process.”

⸻

6. Price Calculation:
	•	Charge €3.50 per curve (per bend, based on the selected model).
	•	When a model is selected, automatically calculate the total based on the number of bends and display it in the price summary.
	•	If “Submit Your Own Design” is chosen → show “Price on request”.

⸻

7. Interface Suggestions:
	•	Use clear spacing between curve models.
	•	Add hover tooltips or info icons on each model explaining its layout.
	•	Add buttons like:
	•	“Choose this model”
	•	“Reset / Choose another model”

⸻

8. Input Validation:
	•	Make all side inputs required before allowing the user to proceed to the next step.
	•	If not filled: show an error message such as:
“Please enter all required measurements before continuing.”
