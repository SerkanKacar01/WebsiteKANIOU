What to do:

Expected Result:
Users understand they can search by product name or keywords.

✅ INSTRUCTION 2: Refine the Category Dropdown with Icons (Optional but Recommended)

Goal: Make the category filter dropdown more visually appealing.

What to do:
	•	For each category listed in the dropdown (e.g., Jaloezieën, Rolgordijnen), optionally add a small inline icon to the left (using a simple SVG or emoji).
	•	Example: 🪟 for window-related items.
	•	Ensure the icon aligns left and doesn’t disrupt the text or spacing.

Expected Result:
The dropdown looks more visual, helping users quickly recognize categories.

	•	“Meest gekozen”
	•	“Nieuwste producten”
	•	“Populair”
	•	“Prijs: Laag naar Hoog”

Goal: Help users understand what the reset button does.

What to do:
	•	Add a tooltip that appears on hover (desktop) or tap (mobile) with this message:
→ "Herstel filters naar standaardwaarden"
	•	Tooltip styling should match your theme (light beige background, soft drop shadow, small text).

Expected Result:
Users better understand the purpose of the reset button, improving usability.

✅ INSTRUCTION 5: Improve Visibility of Product Count Text

Goal: Make the “X producten gevonden” line more visible and prominent.

What to do:
	•	Move the “8 producten gevonden” text to the left or middle of the filter bar.
	•	Place it near the sorting options or above the entire bar if needed.
	•	Use slightly larger font and bold (same style as section headers).

Expected Result:
The number of filtered results is immediately visible and clear to the user.

⸻

✅ INSTRUCTION 6: Optimize the Filter Bar for Mobile Devices

Goal: Make the entire filter bar responsive and mobile-friendly.

What to do:
	•	On screens narrower than 768px:
	•	Stack the filters vertically (search on top, sort & category below).
	•	Keep padding and spacing minimal but readable.
	•	Ensure that all controls are touch-friendly (tap targets at least 44px tall).
	•	Add horizontal scroll if needed for overflow.

Expected Result:
The entire filter bar looks great and functions properly on smartphones and tablets.
