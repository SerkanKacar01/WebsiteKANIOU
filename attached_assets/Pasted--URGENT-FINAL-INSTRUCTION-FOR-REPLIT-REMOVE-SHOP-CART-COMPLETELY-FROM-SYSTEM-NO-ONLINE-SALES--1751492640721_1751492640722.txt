🚨 URGENT FINAL INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT

REMOVE SHOP & CART COMPLETELY FROM SYSTEM – NO ONLINE SALES

🔧 Instruction Language: English (for Replit execution)
🌐 Frontend Content Language: Dutch
📱 Applies to: mobile + desktop
🎯 Objective: The website must no longer have any e-commerce or checkout system active or visible.

⸻

✅ 1. REMOVE “Shop” button (header/top menu)
	•	Delete the “Shop” button from the top navigation bar completely.
	•	The button must not be visible on any page, both desktop and mobile.
	•	If the button is inserted via CMS or navigation component, permanently remove it.

⸻

✅ 2. REMOVE “Winkelwagen” or Cart icon in header
	•	Completely delete the cart icon or cart dropdown from the top bar.
	•	Do not show it even if 1 or more products are added.
	•	Disable any dynamic badge or counter for cart items (e.g. 0 artikelen).

⸻

✅ 3. DISABLE ENTIRE SHOP SYSTEM ROUTES
	•	Deactivate or delete the following pages/routes:
	•	/shop
	•	/winkelwagen
	•	/checkout
	•	/cart
	•	/afrekenen

👉 Redirect all of these to / (home) or return a 404 error with Dutch message:
“Deze pagina is niet beschikbaar.”

⸻

✅ 4. REMOVE “In winkelwagen” buttons from all product pages
	•	On each product page (like HTC 620 Vlekkenformule), remove:
	•	Add-to-cart button
	•	Quantity selector (+ / – buttons)
	•	Price total calculation
	•	“Afrekenen” or payment block

👉 Keep only:
	•	Product name, image, prijs incl. btw, and beschrijving
	•	Example: the product should look like a brochure, not a webshop.

⸻

✅ 5. REMOVE Mollie integration
	•	Disconnect and fully deactivate any Mollie API/payment integration.
	•	If JavaScript code, forms, or tokens are still active, delete them completely.
	•	There must be no payment method active anywhere.

⸻

✅ 6. REMOVE product categories from dropdown IF they link to shop
	•	In the “Producten” dropdown, remove all links that open product shop pages.
	•	You can keep informational categories (zoals “Gordijnrails”) but link them only to non-shopping pages.

⸻

✅ 7. IMPORTANT FOR MOBILE
	•	All of the above steps must also be applied on mobile layout.
	•	No cart icon, no “shop” link, no add-to-cart buttons, no Mollie code.

⸻

✅ 8. CHECKPOINT AFTER REMOVAL

After completing:
	•	Go to homepage
	•	Check the top navigation on desktop + mobile
	•	Try accessing /shop, /winkelwagen, /checkout, etc. — they must NOT work
	•	Visit a product (like HTC 620): only see product info, no cart
