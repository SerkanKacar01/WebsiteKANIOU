Enforce selected language + translate full website knowledge responses

Subject: Chatbot must fully respect selected language and translate all content-based answers

Dear Replit,

Please update the chatbot behavior so that it strictly follows the user’s selected language via the flag dropdown. This must apply to both interface texts and AI-generated responses using the website content.

⸻

Mandatory behavior:
	1.	When a user selects a language via the flag (e.g. 🇫🇷), all chatbot communication must occur in that selected language only.
	•	This includes: welcome message, AI answers, offline messages, fallback replies, button texts, etc.
	2.	The chatbot must not auto-detect and override the selected language.
	•	For example: if the flag is set to English 🇬🇧, it must never respond in Dutch or French, even if the question is written in Dutch.
	3.	The chatbot must use the full website knowledge base (already loaded), and translate all content into the selected language.
	•	This means: all product information, services, FAQs, instructions, measurement details, delivery times, pricing options, etc.
	•	These must be dynamically translated or served in the matching language version.
	4.	No mixed-language output is acceptable.
	•	The chatbot must respond with full, grammatically correct sentences in the user’s chosen language.
	•	Do not combine Dutch and French, or French and English, in any response.

Example (expected result):

Selected language: 🇹🇷 Turkish
User asks: “Stor perde nedir?”
Bot replies (in Turkish):

“Stor perde, pencerelerinize modern ve fonksiyonel bir görünüm kazandıran, kumaştan yapılmış düz bir mekanizmalı perde sistemidir. KANIOU’da farklı kumaş türleri, renkler ve mekanizma seçenekleri mevcuttur.”

⸻

Summary:
	•	The chatbot must lock into the user’s selected language
	•	All website content used in answers must be fully translated into that language
	•	All replies, both standard and AI-generated, must be native-quality and consistent with the selected language
