✅ ENGLISH INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT – INTEGRATE MOLLIE PAYMENT CHECKOUT (LIVE)

Dear Replit support,

Please follow the instructions below to add a full working Mollie payment system to our existing project WebsiteKANIOU, specifically on the last page of the configurator:

⸻

🔧 BACKEND – STEP 1: Install Mollie
	1.	Install the official Mollie Node.js SDK: npm install @mollie/api-client 🔐 BACKEND – STEP 2: Create a secure route to generate payments
	2.	In the backend, create a new route called /create-payment using Express, that does the following:

	•	Uses our LIVE API key:
live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (← please insert this in the correct secure location)
	•	Accepts a POST request with:
	•	amount (float or string with 2 decimals)
	•	description (e.g. “Gordijnrails offerte”)
	•	redirectUrl (after successful payment)
	•	Creates a Mollie payment with these values and returns payment.getCheckoutUrl() to the frontend.
	•	Example redirect URL:
https://kaniou.be/bedankt

⸻

🎯 FRONTEND – STEP 3: Add “Pay Now” button

On the last step of the configurator, after the total price and configuration is shown, please add a button: <button class="btn btn-primary">Pay securely via Mollie</button> Clicking this button should:
	•	Call the /create-payment backend route via fetch() with amount + redirect info.
	•	Redirect the customer to the Mollie checkout page via window.location.href = paymentUrl.

The amount should match the total shown in the summary (Prijs Overzicht).  📜 OPTIONAL – STEP 4: Add a webhook (optional now)

If possible, you can also implement a /webhook-payment route for future tracking of payment status. For now, it’s not required.

⸻

✅ FINAL GOALS
	•	Fully working live checkout via Mollie.
	•	Based on live API key.
	•	Payment summary must be passed correctly.
	•	After payment, redirect to:
https://kaniou.be/bedankt

⸻

Let me know if any adjustments are needed. Thank you!
