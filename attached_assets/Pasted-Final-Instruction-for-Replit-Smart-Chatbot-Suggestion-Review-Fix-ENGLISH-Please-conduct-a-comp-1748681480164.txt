Final Instruction for Replit: Smart Chatbot Suggestion Review & Fix (ENGLISH)

Please conduct a complete verification and implementation of the 6 Smart Suggestion Buttons in the KANIOU chatbot, ensuring everything works correctly on all devices, languages, and user scenarios.

⸻

🔍 PHASE 1 – Smart Button Presence & Visibility
	•	Ensure all 6 smart buttons appear automatically for new users when opening the chatbot
	•	Buttons should reappear for returning users after 24h of inactivity
	•	Buttons should disappear after any interaction or typing
	•	Test this behavior on desktop and mobile

Buttons expected:
	1.	Request free measurement
	2.	Get style advice
	3.	Request a quote
	4.	View product gallery
	5.	What products do you offer?
	6.	Help me choose the right window treatment

⸻

🌍 PHASE 2 – Multilingual Support
	•	All buttons and messages must be properly translated and shown in the correct language (Dutch, French, English, Turkish) based on user selection
	•	Language logic must be locked per selection, no automatic override

⸻

📱 PHASE 3 – Button Styling and Behavior
	•	Ensure responsive layout for all buttons (no overlap or cutoff on mobile)
	•	Add spacing and visual feedback on tap/click
	•	Test hover effect (optional on desktop)
	•	If a user clicks a button (e.g. “Get Style Advice”) → Trigger the correct flow immediately
	•	If user types manually, hide all buttons instantly

⸻

🧠 PHASE 4 – Button Action Testing

Each button must trigger the correct internal flow:
	•	Free Measurement → Load measurement explanation + offer to schedule
	•	Style Advice → Load style consultation flow (room type → style → light/privacy → suggestion)
	•	Quote Request → Show email/name form → send to info@kaniou.be
	•	Product Gallery → Show category or image links of products
	•	Product Info → Show full list of all KANIOU products and short intro
	•	Window Treatment Help → Trigger same style flow as above but simplified wording

⸻

🛠️ PHASE 5 – Debug & Fixes
	•	Check if buttons fail to load or trigger no response
	•	Fix any delay/lag or unresponsiveness in mobile mode
	•	If form (e.g. quote) keeps loading, fix backend submit logic
	•	Confirm email submission is routed to: info@kaniou.be
	•	Ensure no old email like info@kaniou.com appears anywhere in prompts

⸻

Please confirm that:
	•	✅ All 6 buttons work perfectly across all languages
	•	✅ All actions are connected and tested
	•	✅ Email routing, translation, behavior and responsiveness are functional
	•	✅ No visual bugs or infinite loading remain
