Step 4 Instruction for Replit: Smart Suggestion Buttons + Chatbot Flows

Goal:

🧠 Replit Instruction Text (for developers)

Build an intelligent suggestion button system inside the existing KANIOU chatbot interface with the following functionality:

⸻

1. Trigger Logic
	•	Display smart suggestion buttons when:
	•	A user opens the chatbot for the first time.
	•	A returning user has not interacted for 24 hours.
	•	A conversation ends or becomes idle.
	•	Hide buttons immediately if:
	•	The user starts typing.
	•	The user clicks any of the buttons.

⸻

2. Languages
	•	Must support full multilingual text (Dutch, French, English, Turkish).
	•	Suggestions must be translated accordingly based on selected language.
	•	All follow-up chatbot conversations should stay in the selected language.

⸻

3. Button Layout & Style
	•	Mobile-friendly layout with spacing between buttons.
	•	Buttons must follow KANIOU’s design: soft gold/light beige tones with clean, readable text.
	•	Use rounded corners, soft shadow, and hover/click animation (mobile tap-friendly).

4. Core Suggestion Buttons (must be implemented)

Each button must trigger a unique flow within the chatbot:
	1.	🪟 Free Measurement Appointment
→ Leads user to chatbot form for scheduling a home visit (name, address, contact, room type).
	2.	🎨 Get Style Advice
→ Triggers the full AI interior style consultation flow (already implemented in Step 3).
	3.	🧾 Request a Quote
→ Opens chatbot quote request wizard (product, dimensions, budget, contact info). Must send confirmation to info@kaniou.be.
	4.	🖼️ View Product Gallery
→ Opens a carousel or image preview of products (by category) inside the chatbot or as an overlay.
	5.	📦 Product Information
→ Asks user to select a product type, then shows full details from the knowledge base.
	6.	❓ Need Help Choosing?
→ Starts an interactive Q&A that narrows down suitable options based on room, style, and function.

⸻

5. Tracking & Engagement
	•	Save which buttons are clicked per session in the chatbot history.
	•	If none are clicked after 30 seconds, show a reminder prompt like “Need help getting started?”
