Instruction for Replit – Automatic Signup Popup Banner for New Visitors (No Code)

Please implement an automatic popup banner for new visitors on my website to encourage signups for promotions and exclusive offers.

⸻

🎯 Objective:

Show a popup banner automatically when a visitor opens the website for the first time. This popup must offer the opportunity to sign up for promotions, updates, and discounts.

⸻

📍 Popup Trigger:
	•	The popup should automatically appear only once per new visitor session.
	•	Do not show it again on page reload or next visit unless they haven’t interacted or closed it yet.
	•	Use cookies or localStorage to track if the user has already seen or closed the popup.

⸻

🪟 Popup Design:
	•	Use a centered modal-style popup banner.
	•	The banner should include:
	•	Title: “Blijf op de hoogte van acties & kortingen”
	•	Small text: “Schrijf je in en ontvang exclusieve aanbiedingen van KANIOU Zilvernaald.”
	•	Input: Name (optional)
	•	Input: Email address (required)
	•	Checkbox (optional): “Ik ga akkoord met het ontvangen van e-mails”
	•	Submit button: “Inschrijven”
	•	Close button (X)

⸻

🎨 Design Requirements:
	•	Elegant, modern, and consistent with the KANIOU Zilvernaald branding.
	•	Use brand colors like beige, wit, goud, and clean typography.
	•	Make the popup responsive (mobile-friendly).
	•	Add a subtle entrance animation (e.g., fade-in or slide-down).

⸻

📤 Form Submission:
	•	When the form is submitted, send the data (name, email) to:
	•	An email address or
	•	A backend system (Formspree, EmailJS, or custom Replit solution)
	•	After successful submission:
	•	Show a confirmation message:
“Bedankt voor je inschrijving! We houden je op de hoogte.”
	•	Do not show the popup again.

⸻

✅ Additional Behavior:
	•	If the user closes the popup without signing up:
	•	Save a flag to not show the popup again immediately.
	•	Optionally delay the next appearance (e.g. after 7 days).
	•	Ensure no automatic redirection or reload happens after submit or close.
	•	Everything must be smooth, professional, and non-intrusive.

⸻

Please use the best UX practices and styling, and fully integrate the system into my website flow without needing any code adjustments from my side.
