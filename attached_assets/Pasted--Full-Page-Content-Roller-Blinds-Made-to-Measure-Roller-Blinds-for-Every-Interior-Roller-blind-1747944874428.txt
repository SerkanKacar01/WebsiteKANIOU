Fabric Options and Light Control

We offer a wide selection of fabrics, categorized by their level of light filtration:
	â€¢	Blackout fabrics: Completely block out light; ideal for bedrooms or any space requiring full darkness
	â€¢	Light-filtering fabrics: Maintain privacy while allowing natural light to pass through
	â€¢	Transparent fabrics: Let in ample daylight for a light and airy feel â€” great for living spaces
	â€¢	Technical screen fabrics: Woven to reduce glare and solar heat while preserving outdoor visibility

All fabrics are available in a wide range of colors, textures, and finishes. They are treated for UV resistance and dust repellency.

Roller blinds can be installed in various ways depending on your needs:
	â€¢	Inside mount (recessed): Mounted inside the window frame for a minimalist look
