✅ Evaluation of Your Current Product Sales Page

Positives:
	•	Clean, elegant layout with calm colors.
	•	Clear CTA buttons like “Gratis Offerte Aanvragen” and “Bekijk Galerij.”
	•	Categories are well organized (e.g. “Vliegengordijnen”, “Raamdecoratie”).
	•	Footer is informative and matches your brand.
	•	Color harmony and alignment are visually pleasing.

Areas for Improvement:
	1.	Duplicate Header Issue
✅ It looks resolved in your recent screenshots. Good job!
	2.	Hero Section (“Premium Raamdecoratie”)
	•	This section is repeating the homepage tone.
	•	Suggestion: Focus this area only on shopping, not general brand info.
	•	Add: Small intro that tells the user how to shop or browse products here.
	3.	Product Categories
	•	Your cards show good structure, but:
	•	“Bekijk Producten” button feels vague.
	•	Suggested fix: Change to “Bekijk Collectie” or “Shop Nu.”
	•	Add hover effects (like shadow or zoom-in) for interactivity.
	4.	Price Listing
	•	Showing multiple prices is good, but make sure:
	•	It’s clear which variant each price refers to.
	•	Consider adding a small tooltip or label like:
€29.95 (Standaard) / €39.95 (Magnetisch)
	5.	Typography & Spacing
	•	Some titles (like “Onze Productcategorieën”) are slightly large.
	•	Reduce by 10–15% on mobile.
	•	Add more vertical spacing between sections for better mobile UX.
	6.	Section “Hulp nodig bij uw keuze?”
	•	Great idea, but suggest:
	•	Move it higher, just below hero section.
	•	Add small icons for each service (advies, offerte).
	•	Replace beige button with full-width button on mobile.
	7.	Footer
	•	Looks solid. Only improvement:
	•	Add visual separation above footer (a thin line or shadow).
	•	Improve padding on mobile for better readability.
