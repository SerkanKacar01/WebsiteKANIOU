‚úÖ ENGLISH INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT ‚Äì ENABLE & DISPLAY CART FUNCTIONALITY

Goal:
Make sure the shopping cart is fully enabled and always accessible for both desktop and mobile users, allowing customers to review and manage their selected products before checkout.

‚∏ª

1. Ensure the cart system is fully active
	‚Ä¢	Recheck if the cart logic is still implemented and not removed in recent edits.
	‚Ä¢	Reactivate or re-import any CartProvider, CartContext, or relevant state manager if previously removed.
	‚Ä¢	Make sure Add to Cart buttons on each product page (e.g., HTC 620 Vlekkenformule) correctly dispatch an item into the cart context.

‚∏ª

2. Always show the cart icon in the header
	‚Ä¢	The cart icon should be clearly visible in the header on all pages (especially shop-related pages).
	‚Ä¢	The icon must show a badge with the total number of items currently in the cart.
	‚Ä¢	It should be clickable and lead to the cart page (/cart or /winkelwagen).

‚úÖ On desktop: icon should be top-right corner of the header.
‚úÖ On mobile: icon should be in the bottom bar or collapsible menu.

‚∏ª

3. Create or repair the cart page (if removed)
	‚Ä¢	Page should be at path: /cart or /winkelwagen
	‚Ä¢	On the cart page, show:
	‚Ä¢	Product thumbnail
	‚Ä¢	Product name
	‚Ä¢	Quantity selector
	‚Ä¢	Subtotal per item
	‚Ä¢	Total amount (incl. BTW)
	‚Ä¢	Remove button per item
	‚Ä¢	Proceed to payment button (linking to Mollie or Stripe checkout)

‚∏ª

4. Ensure full functionality
	‚Ä¢	All changes in quantity must update totals immediately.
	‚Ä¢	Button to remove products must work without reloading the page.
	‚Ä¢	Cart must persist across page reloads (e.g., via localStorage or context).

‚∏ª

5. Mobile & desktop responsiveness
	‚Ä¢	Cart must look clean and structured on both:
	‚Ä¢	üñ•Ô∏è Desktop (table format or flex)
	‚Ä¢	üì± Mobile (stacked product layout with buttons underneath)

‚∏ª

6. Test and verify
	‚Ä¢	Add 2‚Äì3 products to the cart (like ‚ÄúHTC 620‚Äù, ‚ÄúProfessionele sproeifles‚Äù, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Check if the cart:
	‚Ä¢	Updates totals
	‚Ä¢	Remembers items between pages
	‚Ä¢	Allows users to proceed to checkout

‚∏ª

7. Optional (UX improvement)
	‚Ä¢	When a user clicks ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù, show a temporary confirmation popup (e.g. ‚Äú‚úî Product added to cart‚Äù) to reduce confusion.
	‚Ä¢	Allow users to click ‚ÄúGo to Cart‚Äù or ‚ÄúContinue Shopping‚Äù from that popup.
