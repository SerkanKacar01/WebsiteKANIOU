3. 🧠 Interior Style Advisor
   - Chatbot must handle questions like:
     “What fits best for a modern bedroom with privacy?”
     “Any suggestions for an industrial kitchen?”
     “I need blackout curtains for a child’s room”
   - It must trigger the recommendation logic and respond fully in the selected language.

   - Check every flow in Dutch, French, English, and Turkish.

5. ✅ End Chat Flow
   - After user finishes conversation, chatbot must offer 2 buttons:
     - “End Chat” → show thank-you message and close chat.
     - “Show Options Again” → redisplay the 6 smart suggestions.

6. 📱 Mobile & Desktop Compatibility
   - All buttons and forms must display correctly on mobile.
   - No text overflow or layout breaking.
   - Buttons must have proper padding, sizing and clickable behavior.

7. 📬 Notification Logic
   - If chatbot cannot answer a question due to missing website info, it must:
     - Display a polite fallback message
     - Send the message content to info@kaniou.com
     - Tag it as “unresolved inquiry”

After completing the fixes and verification, please confirm:
- That all 7 features above are working correctly
