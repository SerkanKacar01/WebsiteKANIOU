STEP 5 ‚Äî Add Price Inquiry Detection and Owner Notification System

Objective:
Detect when a user is asking about prices, quotes, cost, or anything that implies a pricing request ‚Äî and automatically notify the business owner (you) to provide a manual price. Once the price is entered, the AI chatbot should learn and reuse it automatically in future conversations.

üîπ Step Description (for Replit Developer):
	1.	Keyword & Intent Detection:
	‚Ä¢	Integrate logic into the chatbot that actively monitors user messages for price-related intent.
	‚Ä¢	Keywords to monitor: "prijs", "prijzen", "offerte", "wat kost", "hoeveel kost", "tarief", "kostprijs", "prijsindicatie", "quote", "quotation", "how much", etc.
	‚Ä¢	This detection should work in all supported languages on the site.
	2.	Trigger Owner Notification:
	‚Ä¢	As soon as a pricing-related message is detected, trigger an automated email alert or dashboard notification (choose the system already in use).
	‚Ä¢	The notification must include:
	‚Ä¢	The exact user question
	‚Ä¢	Product or category (if detected)
	‚Ä¢	Timestamp
	‚Ä¢	Session or user ID (if available)
	3.	Temporary AI Response to Customer:
	‚Ä¢	Respond to the customer with a polite message like:
‚ÄúThanks for your request! We‚Äôre checking the price and will reply very soon. Please stay in this chat or leave your email.‚Äù
	4.	Owner Input Panel:
	‚Ä¢	Build a simple admin panel or popup form where the owner (you) can:
	‚Ä¢	View unanswered pricing questions
	‚Ä¢	Type the exact price or response
	‚Ä¢	Submit it
	5.	AI Learning Memory:
	‚Ä¢	The submitted price or reply must be saved in a secure memory so the chatbot can:
	‚Ä¢	Auto-respond the next time a user asks the same question
	‚Ä¢	Match similar questions using semantic similarity or keywords
	6.	Response Delivery to Customer:
	‚Ä¢	Once the price is entered, the chatbot should:
	‚Ä¢	Automatically reply to the original user with the custom price
	‚Ä¢	Mark the inquiry as ‚Äúresolved‚Äù
	7.	Logs & Review Panel:
	‚Ä¢	Include a log section where the business owner can review:
	‚Ä¢	Past price questions
	‚Ä¢	Given answers
	‚Ä¢	Whether they were auto-answered or owner-submitted

‚∏ª

üîí Important for Replit Developer:
	‚Ä¢	The system must be fully automated after owner submission.
	‚Ä¢	Prices must be reusable intelligently ‚Äî based on context, product type, and user question.
	‚Ä¢	All price logic should respect GDPR (data must not be tied to a person unless consent is given).
