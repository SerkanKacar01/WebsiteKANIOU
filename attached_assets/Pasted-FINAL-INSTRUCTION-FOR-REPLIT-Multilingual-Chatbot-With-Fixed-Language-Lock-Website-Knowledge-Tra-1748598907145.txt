FINAL INSTRUCTION FOR REPLIT — Multilingual Chatbot With Fixed Language Lock & Website Knowledge Translation

⸻

Subject: Chatbot must follow selected language strictly and translate all content-based responses automatically

Dear Replit team,

I’m experiencing issues where the chatbot either responds in the wrong language or provides fallback responses that do not reflect my actual website content.

I now request the following mandatory and specific setup to meet professional multilingual customer expectations:

⸻

🔐 LANGUAGE HANDLING – FIXED BEHAVIOR
	1.	When the user selects a language using the flag selector, that choice must:
	•	Be stored immediately and permanently for the entire session
	•	Be respected by the AI response system, not just the UI
	•	Override any automatic language detection
	2.	The chatbot must not guess or switch languages based on the user’s input once the language is selected manually.
	3.	No responses should ever mix two languages (e.g., a French greeting with Dutch content).

⸻

📚 KNOWLEDGE BASE TRANSLATION – MANDATORY
	4.	The chatbot must use all content from the full website knowledge base (already loaded) including:
	•	All 20+ product categories and their descriptions
	•	Services like free in-home measurement, installation, delivery terms
	•	FAQs, about us, pricing logic, promotional rules
	5.	All of this content must be translated in real time into the language selected by the user. No Dutch content should ever appear if the flag is on French, English, or Turkish.
	6.	Translations must be complete, grammatically correct, and professional. No machine literal output.

⸻

🔄 DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR REQUIRED
	7.	When a user asks a question like:
	•	“Do you offer installation?” → Response must come in English
	•	“Komen jullie meten?” → Response must come in Dutch
	•	“Est-ce que vous installez les stores ?” → Response must come in French
	•	“Perde montajı yapıyor musunuz?” → Response must come in Turkish
	8.	The answer must use real information from my website, translated to the correct language — not a generic placeholder or unsupported fallback.

⸻

💬 SYSTEM MESSAGES – TRANSLATED TOO
	9.	All system messages must be available in all 4 languages:
	•	Welcome messages
	•	“We are offline” messages
	•	“Please wait…” or “Typing…” messages
	•	Button labels
	•	Error notifications
	10.	These must be fully translated and match the selected flag.

⸻

🌍 SUPPORTED LANGUAGES

Required active language support:
	•	Dutch 🇳🇱 (default)
	•	French 🇫🇷
	•	English 🇬🇧
	•	Turkish 🇹🇷
(Optional later: Arabic 🇸🇦)

⸻

✅ Final Goal
	•	The chatbot becomes a professional multilingual assistant
	•	It uses my real website content (already loaded)
	•	It fully respects the user’s language choice
	•	It translates all answers accurately and smoothly into that language
	•	It does not default to Dutch or fallback messages at any point
